# Setup

## Using virtual env
```
git clone https://github.com/kiminzajnr/RESTful-Flask-API.git
cd RESTful-Flask-API
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the app

flask run
```

## Using docker
```
git clone https://github.com/kiminzajnr/RESTful-Flask-API.git
cd RESTful-Flask-API
docker build -t flask-api .
docker run -dp 5000:5000 -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" flask-api
```

#### Common errors when using docker
`Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:5000 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:5000: bind: address already in use.`

- Use another port:
    - `docker run -dp 5005:5000 -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" flask-api`
- Or, kill process running on the port if not needed:
    - Run `lsof -i :5000` and note the `PID`
    - Run `kill -9 PID` - `PID` obtained from above

`docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at ... docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.`
- If on macOS/Windows run docker desktop.
- On Linux start docker service.
